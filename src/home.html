            welcome to my private "hackerish" website, here I will write about some stuff or keep
            notes, this website is more to show what I can do with vanilla JS.

            <p>
                I am self taught programmer, my first programming language was 
                <span class="accent">Python</span> and from there I just keeped on going, I mastered
                Python, used frameworks like Django, pyqt, created some tools after that, I moved to 
                <span class="accent">javascript</span>, from there I learned a bit of <span class="accent">react</span>,
                and I didn't really liked it so I leaned <span class="accent">Angular</span> and I am playing with it untils
                this day, after that I learned (and still leaning) <span class="accent">C</span>, for some reason C is <span class="mark">my favorite
                language</span>, even that I am n00b at C, I love programming and networking as well.
            </p>

            <p>
                I leaned networking at highschool, from there I continued with the networking
                to the college, <span class="mark">at the same time of leaning networking I leaned programming</span>, and 
                got a <span class="accent">CCNA</span> certificate.

            <p>
                this website is running on gitpages, because git pages gives free hosting :), so I use 
                mini hacks to make the site "look more good", ofc they come with a downside, for example,
                to make the site URL look more nice with the <span class="accent">window.history.pushState()</span>, but
                if you refresh or copy the URL it will result in <span class="warn">404 ERROR</span>, thats why I created a warnning message
                that will be only displayed in the production, and created a feature that copies the correct URL 
                if the user requires.
            </p>
            <p>
                the website uses: <span class="accent">typescript</span>, <span class="accent">webpack</span> and <span class="accent">scss</span>, there
                are no frameworks like Angular, vue, react, this is pure javascript site.
